This Project is literally my version of a online resume.

I have been a part of the amazing program code louisville and the fasinating teaching of teamtreehouse.com
and this is my first attempt and succession of a wed design that is responsive and user-friendly.

This resume is very basic but shows the skills I want to advertise that I have learned on my coding journey
so far (of course learning this will never stop).

Informates and employers, I will appreciate all feedback.

Thank you for taking the time to look at my page.

FT: navbar complete with 3 tabs to learn my: interest, about me, and contact
  stylings: done with little of my own but the implemation of Bootstrap (next design: Foundation)
